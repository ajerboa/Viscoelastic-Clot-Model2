# Viscoelastic Clot Model
This is the repository for the model developed and proposed in the paper: "Quick Model-Based Viscoelastic Clot Strength Predictions from Blood Protein Concentrations for Cybermedical Coagulation Control"

# System Requirements
## Hardware Requirements
This model only requires a standard computer with enough RAM to support in-memory operations.

## Software Requirements
Running the model code requires MATLAB R2021a or newer (recommendation). Install MATLAB according to MathWorks installation guide [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/install-products.html).

# Initializing and User Instructions
1. Open MATLAB.
2. Add folder of downloaded .m and .xlsx files to MATLAB directory.
3. Run desired MATLAB scripts (see *Plot Locations* for file to figure correspondence).
4. Estimated run time is less than a minute for all files.
